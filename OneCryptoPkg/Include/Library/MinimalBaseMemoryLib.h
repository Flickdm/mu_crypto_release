  Copies a source buffer to a destination buffer, and returns the destination buffer.

  This function copies Length bytes from SourceBuffer to DestinationBuffer, and returns
  DestinationBuffer.  The implementation must be reentrant, and it must handle the case
  where SourceBuffer overlaps DestinationBuffer.

  If Length is greater than (MAX_ADDRESS - DestinationBuffer + 1), then ASSERT().
  If Length is greater than (MAX_ADDRESS - SourceBuffer + 1), then ASSERT().

  @param  DestinationBuffer   The pointer to the destination buffer of the memory copy.
  @param  SourceBuffer        The pointer to the source buffer of the memory copy.
  @param  Length              The number of bytes to copy from SourceBuffer to DestinationBuffer.

  @return DestinationBuffer.

  Compares the contents of two buffers.

  This function compares Length bytes of SourceBuffer to Length bytes of DestinationBuffer.
  If all Length bytes of the two buffers are identical, then 0 is returned.  Otherwise, the
  value returned is the first mismatched byte in SourceBuffer subtracted from the first
  mismatched byte in DestinationBuffer.

  If Length > 0 and SourceBuffer is NULL, then ASSERT().
  If Length is greater than (MAX_ADDRESS - DestinationBuffer + 1), then ASSERT().

  @param  DestinationBuffer A pointer to the destination buffer to compare.
  @param  SourceBuffer      A pointer to the source buffer to compare.
  @param  Length            The number of bytes to compare.

  @return 0                 All Length bytes of the two buffers are identical.
